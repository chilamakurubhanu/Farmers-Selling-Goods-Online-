            <h2>About Farmer's Market</h2>
            <p>
                A Farmer's Market is a public market where farmers and producers sell their products directly to consumers. These markets provide an opportunity for local farmers to showcase their fresh produce, dairy, meats, and other agricultural products while allowing consumers to purchase fresh and often organic goods.
            </p>
            <p>
                Farmer's Markets have become increasingly popular in recent years due to the growing demand for local, sustainable food sources. They offer a chance for consumers to meet the people who grow their food, fostering a sense of community and support for local economies. Many markets also feature prepared foods, baked goods, and artisanal products, enhancing the shopping experience.
